# ChorPolice
The classic game of চোর পুলিশ that Bangladeshis know.

# How to Play
In singleplayer I've decided for the player to always get the police
You are the purple box

পুলিশ = Police
চোর = Thief/Chor
ডাকাত = Robber/Dakat
বাবু = Head of the Police/Babu

Everyone gets a box or what I call paper because in real life we play with paper.
Everyone gets a role on their paper.

## Points
Babu gets 700 points and does nothing.
Police chooses who the chor or dakat is (look at the header to know which one). If correct, they get 500 and if not, they get nothing.
Dakat gets 600 if they was not caught on the dakat choosing turn but if they were, then they get nothing.
Chor steals what a player would originally get when that player got nothing.

And you just play until you wanna stop. At that time, press the green-ish button on the button to see the results of player 1-4.
